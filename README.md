# Strain identification using colony morphology and machine learning

Counting the composition of a microbial community by plating is a common experiment, but it is often time consuming. In this approach, images of agar plates with multiple single colonies are used as input. The images are segmented to isolate individual colonies, which are then analyzed by a machine learning algorithm that identifies the strain based on colony morphology. Finally, the colony counts are aggregated to compute the overall composition of the microbial community.

The machine learning model was trained on [*E.coli* K12 Keio strain](doi:10.1038/msb4100050) colony images.
